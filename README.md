## OBS
unfortunately the project is not 100% - I need to better understand how to pass and manipulate states in recursive components in React, so I can go back and finish perfectly - as I dont had much free time in the last few days could not search properly.. I believe that the layout and navigation of the user were good for computer, it would be possible to leave cool for mobile phones also with a scroll as the margin between lists.

Anyway, I'm sending the project. I'll love suggestions and comments :D
