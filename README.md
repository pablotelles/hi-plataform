## OBS
unfortunately the project is not 100% - the "checkbox" functionality from parent to child and the other way around didn't work perfectly.
I need to better understand how to pass and manipulate states in recursive components in React, so I can go back and finish perfectly - as I dont had much free time in the last few days could not search properly...sorry.

Anyway, I'm sent the project in the current state. I'll love suggestions and comments :D
